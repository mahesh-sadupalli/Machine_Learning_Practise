# Machine_Learning_Practise

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share a collection of machine learning coding samples. These samples illustrate various algorithms, techniques, and best practices in the field of machine learning.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of machine learning projects and experiments. It is intended for educational purposes, to showcase work to potential employers or collaborators, and to contribute to the community by sharing knowledge and code.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in the repository is a standalone project or a set of related scripts. They include comments and documentation to explain the implementation and usage.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for writing machine learning code.
- Libraries: Various ML libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, and more.
- Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive coding and tutorials.
